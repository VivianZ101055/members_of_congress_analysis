# members_of_congress_analysis
Analysis and visualization of Voteview data on senators and congress people.

I use the database of DW-Nominate scores. Info here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOMINATE_(scaling_method).

At its core, the data seeks to use data about legislators’ choices (in this case, roll-call voting) to “map” legislators’ ideological positions.

From the VoteView information page, “the primary dimension through most of American history has been”liberal" vs. “conservative” (also referred to as “left” vs. “right”). A second dimension picks up differences within the major political parties over slavery, currency, nativism, civil rights, and lifestyle issues during periods of American history." For this task, I'm going to focus on where members of congress fall on dimension 1, listed in the data as nominate_dim1.
